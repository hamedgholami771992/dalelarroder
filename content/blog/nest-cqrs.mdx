## CQRS in a Library Analogy

- Commands (Borrowing Books Desk):
  When you want to borrow a book, you go to the borrowing desk.
  Here, you're changing the state of the library (a book is going out).
  In software, a command changes the state of the application, like updating a user's profile or placing an order.

- Queries (Information Desk):
  If you need to find information, like which books are available or where to find a certain genre, you go to the information desk.
  You're not changing any state; you're just retrieving information.
  In CQRS, a query is like this info desk, where you ask for data but don't alter anything.

- Command Handlers (Librarians at Borrowing Desk):
  The librarians at this desk are trained to process your borrowing requests. In a NestJS application,
  command handlers take a command (like "borrow this book") and handle the logic to perform the necessary actions (update the library system to show the book is borrowed).

- Query Handlers (Librarians at Information Desk):
  The librarians at this desk answer your questions about the books.
  They don't let you take books; they just provide information.
  Similarly, in software, query handlers take a request for information and return the appropriate data from the database.

- Events (Announcements):
  Sometimes, when a book is returned or a new book arrives, the library makes an announcement.
  This is similar to events in software, which signal that something has happened (like a "book returned" event).

- Sagas (Event Coordinators):
  Imagine there are event coordinators who plan out a series of actions when an event occurs.
  For example, when a popular book is returned, they might arrange a display or notify people who were waiting for it.
  In CQRS, a saga is a process manager that handles a series of events and commands to complete a particular sequence of actions.

- Module Setup (Library Organization):
  The library is organized with different sections and rules on how to borrow or get information.
  In NestJS, setting up a module involves organizing and connecting all the parts (commands, queries, handlers, etc.) to work together properly.

## Simplified Implementation Steps in NestJS

If we translate this back to technical terms for implementing a CQRS pattern in a NestJS application:

1- Install CQRS Module: This is like getting the necessary furniture and equipment for your library desks.
2- Define Commands and Queries: Write down the types of requests visitors can make at each desk.
3- Implement Command and Query Handlers: Train librarians on how to process each type of request.
4- Handle Events with Event Handlers: Set up a system to make announcements when certain things happen in the library.
5- Design Sagas for Complex Workflows: Plan out how to manage events that require multiple steps and coordination.
6- Organize Your Module: Ensure that your library desks are well-organized and ready to handle visitors' requests.

By using CQRS, we essentially create a clear and efficient structure within our application (or library) that separates actions that change data from those that read data.
This can lead to a more organized, scalable, and maintainable system.

# Implementing CQRS with NestJS

NestJS provides a CQRS module that you can use to implement the pattern in your applications.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the CQRS package:

```bash
$ npm install --save @nestjs/cqrs
```

## Commands

Commands change the state of the application. They are dispatched to command handlers, which contain the logic to perform the necessary state changes.

Example: Command and Command Handler

```ts
// heroes-game.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class HeroesGameService {
  constructor(private commandBus: CommandBus) {}

  async killDragon(heroId: string, killDragonDto: KillDragonDto) {
    return this.commandBus.execute(new KillDragonCommand(heroId, killDragonDto.dragonId));
  }
}

// kill-dragon.command.ts
export class KillDragonCommand {
  constructor(
    public readonly heroId: string,
    public readonly dragonId: string
  ) {}
}
```

## Queries

Queries retrieve data from the application state. Like commands, they are dispatched to their respective handlers, which handle the data retrieval.

## Events

Events are used to signal state changes within the application. They can be dispatched by models or using the EventBus.

Example: Event Class

```ts
// hero-killed-dragon.event.ts
export class HeroKilledDragonEvent {
  constructor(
    public readonly heroId: string,
    public readonly dragonId: string
  ) {}
}
```

## Sagas

Sagas manage long-running processes and complex business transactions. They listen to events and may dispatch commands in response to those events.

Example: Saga

```ts
@Injectable()
export class HeroesGameSagas {
  @Saga()
  dragonKilled = (events$: Observable<any>): Observable<ICommand> => {
    return events$.pipe(
      ofType(HeroKilledDragonEvent),
      map((event) => new DropAncientItemCommand(event.heroId, fakeItemID))
    );
  };
}
```

## Module Setup

In the module setup, all command handlers, event handlers, and sagas are registered with the module.

Example: Module Setup

```ts
// heroes-game.module.ts
@Module({
  imports: [CqrsModule],
  controllers: [HeroesGameController],
  providers: [
    HeroesGameService,
    HeroesGameSagas,
    ...CommandHandlers,
    ...EventHandlers,
    HeroRepository,
  ],
})
export class HeroesGameModule {}
```

## Unhandled Exceptions

Event handlers run asynchronously and should handle exceptions to avoid leaving the app in an inconsistent state.

Example: Handling Unhandled Exceptions

```ts
constructor(private unhandledExceptionsBus: UnhandledExceptionBus) {
  this.unhandledExceptionsBus
    .pipe(takeUntil(this.destroy$))
    .subscribe((exceptionInfo) => {
      // Handle exception here
    });
}
```

## Subscribing to All Events

You can subscribe to all event streams, which could be useful for logging or storing events in an event store.

Example: Subscribing to Events

```ts
constructor(private eventBus: EventBus) {
  this.eventBus
    .pipe(takeUntil(this.destroy$))
    .subscribe((event) => {
      // Save events to database
    });
}
```

This is a high-level overview of the CQRS pattern and how to implement it using NestJS.
Each section contains example code snippets that show how to define commands, command handlers, events, event handlers, sagas, and how to handle exceptions, which are all part of building a CQRS-based application.
