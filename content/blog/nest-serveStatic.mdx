## Overview

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={4} />

Sure, let's go through the part of the guide that explains how to serve static content, such as a Single Page Application (SPA), using NestJS with the @nestjs/serve-static package.

# Serve Static Content with NestJS

## Installation

    To serve static files in a NestJS application, you'll need to install the @nestjs/serve-static package.
    This package provides the ServeStaticModule that will enable your NestJS app to serve static content.

    Here's how you install the package using npm:
    ```bash
    $ npm install --save @nestjs/serve-static
    ```

## Bootstrap

After installing the package, you need to set up the ServeStaticModule in your NestJS application.
This is usually done in the root module of your application, often called AppModule.
You'll import ServeStaticModule and use the forRoot() method to configure it.

Here's an example of how to do this:

```bash
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { ServeStaticModule } from '@nestjs/serve-static';
import { join } from 'path';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ServeStaticModule.forRoot({
      rootPath: join(__dirname, '..', 'client'), // The 'client' directory should contain your SPA's static assets
    }),
  ],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In the example above, rootPath is set to point to a directory named client which is assumed to be at the root level of your project (one level up from the src directory where your server code resides).
This directory should contain the built static files of your SPA.

## Configuration

    The ServeStaticModule can be fine-tuned with various options:

    <ul>
        <li>serveRoot: Defines the path under which the static app will be served.</li>
        <li>renderPath: Indicates the path that should be handled by the static app (default is * which means all paths).</li>
        <li>exclude: Specifies an array of paths to exclude from static serving.</li>
        <li>setHeaders: Function to set custom headers on the HTTP response.</li>
        <li>cacheControl: Enables or disables setting the Cache-Control header by the module.</li>
        <li>These options allow you to customize how your static files are served according to your application's needs.</li>
    </ul>

## Notice

By default, the ServeStaticModule will serve the index.html file for all paths (\*) which is typical behavior for a SPA where client-side routing handles different "paths" of the application. '
If there are specific server routes defined in your controllers, those will take precedence over the static files.

For example, if you have a route in your controllers for /api/users, that will be served by your controller logic, not your static content.
However, if a user navigates to /about, and there is no corresponding server-side route, the static module will serve the index.html file, and the client-side router would handle the /about route.

It is important to note that for client-side routing to work properly, the server must correctly serve the index.html for all navigation routes managed by the SPA's router.
That's why the default renderPath is set to \*, to ensure that navigation requests that do not match server-side routes fall back to the SPA.

This setup allows you to host both your API and your SPA within the same NestJS application, making it convenient for deployment and management.
