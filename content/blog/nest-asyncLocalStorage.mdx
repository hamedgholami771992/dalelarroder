Async Local Storage (ALS) in Node.js

What is AsyncLocalStorage?:
AsyncLocalStorage is a Node.js API that facilitates tracking of context across asynchronous operations.
It's similar to thread-local storage in other programming languages.
It allows you to store and access data specific to an individual execution chain (e.g., a request in a web server) without having to pass this data through function parameters.

How Does it Work?:
You use AsyncLocalStorage#run to wrap a function call.
The code executed within this wrapped call has access to a storage area specific to that execution chain.
This means you can set and retrieve data that is scoped to a specific asynchronous flow, like a web request.

Using ALS in NestJS

Application in NestJS:

In NestJS, if you find a place in the request's lifecycle to wrap the code with AsyncLocalStorage#run, you can create and access state unique to that request.
This can serve as an alternative to REQUEST-scoped providers, allowing for cleaner and more isolated handling of request-specific data.

Custom Implementation Example:
Create a new instance of AsyncLocalStorage and encapsulate it in a NestJS module (AlsModule).
Use middleware in NestJS to wrap incoming requests with AsyncLocalStorage#run, allowing the entire request handling pipeline to have access to a unique storage per request.
Access the storage anywhere in your NestJS application to retrieve or set data specific to the current request.

ALS Middleware in NestJS:
Implement a middleware that uses AsyncLocalStorage#run to wrap the next function, initializing a storage with values based on the request (e.g., a user ID from the request headers).
This setup allows any part of your NestJS application handling that request to access the storage via AsyncLocalStorage.

Usage in Services:
Services can inject AsyncLocalStorage and use getStore() to access the storage specific to the current request.
This allows services to operate with data that is isolated to each request without explicitly passing this data through each function call.
NestJS CLS Package

What is nestjs-cls?:
It's a third-party package that provides an abstraction over the raw AsyncLocalStorage API, offering improvements like initialization for different transports and strong typing support.
It abstracts ALS into a ClsModule and a ClsService.

Usage:
Import ClsModule in your root module and configure it.
Use ClsService to access the storage values in your services.

Testing:
ClsService can be mocked in unit tests.
For integration tests where you want to use the real ClsService, wrap the code with ClsService#run or ClsService#runWith to provide a specific context.

Summary
AsyncLocalStorage in Node.js allows for tracking context-specific data across asynchronous calls without explicitly passing it through function parameters.
In NestJS, you can use ALS to create and manage request-specific state, offering an alternative to REQUEST-scoped providers.
The nestjs-cls package provides a more convenient and type-safe way to use ALS in NestJS, with easier configuration and integration.
ALS and nestjs-cls can be particularly useful for maintaining context in applications with complex asynchronous flows, such as those common in web servers.
